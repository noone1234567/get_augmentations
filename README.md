Before using optuna create a super-short(like 15 frames) yuv video to pass it, if you don't do that the computation will take forever  
Also don't forget to pass the same output file in optuna(not passing any should work and save every filtered video in out.yuv  
  
  
files look like this:  
  
Your folder  
.spatter.py  
.tools.py  
.abstract.py  
.videos  
..crowd_run_short_1920x1080_50.yuv  
..the rest of the videos
